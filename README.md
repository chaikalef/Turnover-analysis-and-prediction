# Turnover-analysis-and-prediction
Tasks:
1. to make analytics according to the order history,
2. predict the turnover for a certain period of time,
3. estimate forecast error.

Stages of problem solving:
1. deletion of 2013, as it relates to the time of the start of work;
2. filtering data from incorrect or atypical;
3. construction of a pivot table (turnover, the number of orders, average receipts by months with the division into primary and repeat orders);
4. construction of seasonality indices (primary plus secondary orders) for turnover;
